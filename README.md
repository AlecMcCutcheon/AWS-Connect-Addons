# AWS-Connect-Addons

Disclaimer: This unpacked extension runs its code directly from this GitHub, the thought being that for internal use,
it makes it easier for me to distribute updates of the add-ons to others without having to officially hosted on the chrome web store. 
With that being said, it should work in any instance of Amazon connect and you are welcome to use it if you would like, 
just keep in mind that the way that it is written currently, any code changes will be pushed directly to you, 
which might not align with your security practices.

Note: The extension saves all data to local storage and it's not tied to your AWS account. Meaning if you switch browsers or clear your browsing data you might have to reconfigure the settings to your liking.

Currently The unpacked extension provides these Addons

* A Customizable Sub-Second Refresh for AWS Connect Real Time Metrics Page With Auto-Pause on button interaction. (Saves Automatically) 
* A Dark Mode and theme toggle switch (Under Actions) for AWS Connect Real Time Metrics Page. (Saves Automatically) 
* An Setting to Configure Auto-ClockOut in the AWS Softphone Page, which will set you to Offline at the desired time. (Saves Automatically)
