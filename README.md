# AWS-Connect-Addons

Disclaimer: This unpacked extension runs its code directly from this GitHub, the thought being that for internal use,
it makes it easier for me to distribute updates of the add-ons to others without having to officially host it on the chrome web store. 
With that being said, it should work in any instance of Amazon connect and you are welcome to use it if you would like, 
just keep in mind that the way that it is written currently, any code changes will be pushed directly to you, 
which might not align with your security practices.

Note: The extension saves all data to local storage and is not tied to your AWS account. Meaning if you switch browsers or clear your browsing data you might have to reconfigure the settings to your liking.

# Using The Unpacked Extension.

1) Download and Unzip the Repo
2) Place "AWS Custom Addons" Somewhere convenient, but do not move it after adding it to your browser.
4) open a chromium based browser and navigate to extensions
5) flip the "Developer Mode" Switch
6) click on "Load Unpacked"
7) navigate to your "AWS Custom Addons" folder, and click Select.
8) Done! Reload The AWS Pages affected by the extension to see the changes

When updates are pushed through github you will see the changes next time you reload the pages.
